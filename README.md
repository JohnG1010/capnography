# capnography
Hold information for a capnograph made from an industrial gas sensor and a raspberry pi.

Over the course of several months at the University of Bath a GSS SprintIR-R sensor was used in tandom with a raspberry pi 4 model b to create a 
working low-cost capnograph. To operate, download necessary files and libraries onto a raspberry pi, connect the gas sensor, and run the main code.

Included are the step files for the 3D printed casing to encase the capnograph.
